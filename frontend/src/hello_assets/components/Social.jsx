            <p>IC Birds is a decentralized NFT game built on the Internet Computer. It's a new way to have fun while playing with a unique collection of nfts.</p>
            <p>To be able to play the game you need to own at least one of each kind of NFT : a bird, a pipe and a background.</p>
            <p>You are able to collect and play with your favorite birds, pipes and backgrounds.</p>
            <p>The nfts can be minted and exchanged through the entrepot app marketplace and brought into this decentralized game each with their unique style.</p>
            <p>We have a lot of ideas to increase usecase of nfts like adding a token that will be a collectible and NFTs will have yielding when DEXs will be released.</p>
            <p>This project have been selected by the DFINITY foundation to receive a grant.</p>
